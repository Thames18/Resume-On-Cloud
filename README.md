# Resume-On-Cloud

## Overview

<a href="http://mustafalsalem.click/" rel="nofollow">Cloud Resume</a> is a dynamic, highly available personal resume website hosted on AWS. This project leverages a combination of AWS services, Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and a fully automated CI/CD pipeline. It incorporates advanced monitoring, alerting, and logging mechanisms through CloudWatch, PagerDuty, Slack, and Jira, ensuring optimal performance and system reliability.

## Features

- **Static Website Hosting:** The website is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket and distributed globally via CloudFront with Origin Access Control (OAC).
- **Custom Domain:** Route 53 manages domain configurations, including MX records for email routing.
- **Visitor Tracking:** Tracks visitor activity using a serverless backend powered by API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Utilizes Terraform to provision and manage AWS resources.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions automates the deployment process for frontend updates.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Integrates CloudWatch, PagerDuty, Slack, and Jira for comprehensive monitoring and incident management.
- **CloudWatch Alarms:** Tracks metrics such as Lambda invocation errors and monthly AWS costs.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Static Website Hosting**
- **Technology:** Amazon S3, CloudFront
- **Details:** The resume website is hosted in an S3 bucket and distributed worldwide via CloudFront with OAC, ensuring secure and fast content delivery.

### 2. **Visitor Tracking**
- **Technology:** REST API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB
- **Details:**
  - API Gateway triggers an AWS Lambda function.
  - The Lambda function updates visitor statistics in DynamoDB and retrieves data for display on the frontend.

### 3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **Technology:** Terraform
- **Details:** All AWS infrastructure components are managed as code, allowing version control, reproducibility, and simplified infrastructure provisioning.

### 4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
- **Technology:** GitHub Actions
- **Details:** Automates frontend deployment, ensuring smooth and rapid updates without manual intervention.

### 5. **Monitoring and Incident Management**
- **Technology:** CloudWatch, PagerDuty, Slack, Jira
- **Details:**
  - **CloudWatch:** Monitors system performance and logs operational events.
  - **PagerDuty:** Escalates critical alerts for immediate response.
  - **Slack:** Provides real-time notifications for system events.
  - **Jira:** Logs incidents and manages issue resolution workflows.

## Future Improvements

ðŸ”¹ Expand CI/CD pipeline to automate Terraform-based infrastructure updates.

ðŸ”¹ Implement a resume download feature for enhanced usability.
